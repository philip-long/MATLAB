# GS_Platform

* This folder contains kinematic and dynamic function modeling a gough stewart platform
* RigidFunctions contains functions that assume a purely rigid system
* FlexibleFunctions contains functions where the platform can deform or vibrate and this deformation is modeled by mode shapes
